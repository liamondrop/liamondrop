<h3>ABOUT LIAM</h3>

<p>Hi there! I am an engineer working on JavaScript (for web) and Pythong (for machine learning and AI). Currently working at <a href="http://lifion.com/">Lifion by ADP</a>, building a platform to build applications on the web and mobile.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html">this article</a> recently, and it struck a chord. Therefore, watch <a href="https://github.com/liamondrop">my profile</a> for new open source projects, which should start popping up as I find the time to create them.</p>

<p>You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/liamondrop">Twitter</a> or peruse my work history <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/liamondrop">here</a>.</p>
